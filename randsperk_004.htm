		<div>A typical radon system takes one full day to install. The process for setting up and installing&nbsp;such a&nbsp;system is outlined  
		below: </div>  
		<div>&nbsp;</div>  
		<div>&nbsp;</div>  
		<div>1) After discovering high radon levels in their home, the customer contacts Rand's Perk and provides details related  
		to the house specifications (e.g. How many stories tall is the house?&nbsp; Is the basement finished?).&nbsp; For a typical home Rand's  
		Perk does not need to inspect the house prior to providing a quote, although under certain conditions a no-cost inspection may be  
		required.&nbsp;Typically the price quote is provided immediatly over the phone, although an in-writing quote will be provided,&nbsp;upon  
		request. </div>  
		<div>&nbsp;</div>  
		<div>&nbsp;</div>  
		<div>2) A&nbsp;special sealant is used to close all of the cracks and gaps that are present in the basement floor.&nbsp;Closing  
		these gaps ensures the system will properly remove the gas from below the basement floor <u>before</u> it enters the living space. </div>  
		<div>&nbsp;</div>  
		<div>&nbsp;</div>  
		<div>3)  
		A small hole is drilled in both the concrete </div>  
		<div>flooring and in the side of the house in a discrete </div>  
		<div>location.&nbsp; These holes are large  
		enough to </div>  
		<div>accomodate a 4" pipe, which expunges the radon </div>  
		<div>gas from the building. </div>  
		<div>&nbsp;</div>  
		<div>&nbsp;</div>  
		<div>4) The piping is installed with an in-line&nbsp;fan  
		that is specifically designed to&nbsp;draw the air from below the basement floor, to out of the house and away from the living space.&nbsp;  
		This fan&nbsp;runs continuously, but is&nbsp;energy-efficient in that it draws about the same amount of energy as a 100W light bulb.</div>  
		<div>&nbsp;</div>  
		<div>&nbsp;</div>  
		<div>5)  
		The house will be re-tested using a certified radon mitigation tester <u>at no cost to you</u>.&nbsp; The radon levels in your house are&nbsp;guaranteed  
		to be reduced to less than 4.0 pCi/L <strong>or we will fix it&nbsp;at no additional charge.</strong></div>
